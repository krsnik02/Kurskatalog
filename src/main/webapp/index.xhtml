		<h2>About Kurskatalog</h2>
    		<div id="about">
    <p> One frustration which many students at Houghton (and elsewhere) face is the lack of an well-designed,
    easily-accessible, searchable course catalog. While the PDF availiable on Houghton's website is searchable,
    it does nothing else to help the student. It should also be noted that the course catalog and list of
    available courses are currently completely separate.</p>

    <p>To solve this issue, we propose the creation of a web application using JPA and J2EE to supply all course
    information including scheduling tools to ease the lives of the administration, professors, students, and
    even prosepctive students. The administration and professors will be able to add and remove courses, including
    such information as the course name, department, course description and pre/co-requisites. From this listing
    of all courses, the adminstration can craft a list of courses offered each semester, additionally including
    information such as the course location, professor and number of seats.</p>
		
    <p>Students will then be able to browse these course lists and register for courses. Non-registered users
    (guests) will be able to view the catalogs and search for courses by various critera, such as course name,
    department, professor, or time, while logged in students will be additionally able to register for courses
    and search based on their eligibility for various courses.</p>
